# Feature Specification: 3D JavaScript Portfolio Bedroom

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-javascript`
**Created**: 2025-09-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a JavaScript portfolio that is a 3D representation of my bedroom, with a computer where you can see, in a Windows simulation, my projects in more detail. Also have paintings on the wall representing my certifications, a bookshelf with my tech stack that I've previously used in professional projects or learning projects, and a section showcasing some of my hobbies to complement and add content to the bedroom, creating a more fluid and enjoyable setting."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a visitor to the portfolio, I can explore a 3D representation of a bedroom to learn about the owner's professional projects, certifications, technical skills, and hobbies in an interactive and engaging way.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the 3D bedroom is loaded, **When** I navigate to the computer, **Then** I can interact with a simulated Windows environment to view detailed project information.
2. **Given** the 3D bedroom is loaded, **When** I look at the walls, **Then** I can see paintings representing professional certifications.
3. **Given** the 3D bedroom is loaded, **When** I view the bookshelf, **Then** I can see representations of the tech stack used by the portfolio owner.
4. **Given** the 3D bedroom is loaded, **When** I explore the room, **Then** I can find a section showcasing the owner's hobbies.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the 3D model fails to load?
- How does the user navigate the 3D space? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the navigation controls? Keyboard, mouse, other?]
- What happens if a user clicks on an object that is not interactive?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a 3D model of a bedroom.
- **FR-002**: The 3D bedroom MUST contain a computer, paintings on the wall, a bookshelf, and a hobby section.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to interact with the computer to see a simulation of a Windows environment.
- **FR-004**: The Windows simulation MUST display detailed information about the owner's projects. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What project details should be displayed? e.g., description, technologies, links]
- **FR-005**: The paintings on the wall MUST represent the owner's certifications. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which certifications should be displayed? How are they represented?]
- **FR-006**: The bookshelf MUST represent the owner's tech stack. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What technologies are in the tech stack? How are they represented on the bookshelf?]
- **FR-007**: The hobby section MUST showcase the owner's hobbies. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What hobbies should be showcased? How are they represented?]
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide a fluid and enjoyable user experience. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific metrics for "fluid and enjoyable"? e.g., frame rate, loading time]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Project**: Represents a professional or learning project. Attributes: name, description, technologies used, link to project/repository.
- **Certification**: Represents a professional certification. Attributes: name, issuing organization, date obtained.
- **Technology**: Represents a technology in the tech stack. Attributes: name, type (e.g., language, framework).
- **Hobby**: Represents a hobby. Attributes: name, description/representation.
